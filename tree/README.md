## The Problem
Make a Tree Data Structure
### Node Implementation
Create a node class. The constructor should accept an argument that gets assigned to the data property and initialize an empty array for storing children. The node class should have methods 'add' and 'remove'

### Tree Implementation
Create a tree class. The tree constructor should initialize a 'root' property to null

## Output
